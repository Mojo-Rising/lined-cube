Create a new P5js sketch.

* Create an svg element
* Create a viewBox of 1000x1000 in that svg element at x 0, y 0
* Draw a grid of 10x10 lines
* Save the svg element as an svg file and call it grid.svg
* Create a html file with an svg element in it and use your grid.svg as background for it
* Using lines, draw a cube and align it with the grid

Tip: Use the following code to draw lines every x pixels
```
for(var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  // pseudo code: drawLineAt(x * i)
}
```
